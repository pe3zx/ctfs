# Nigeria - God - Misc 100

Dear Lord,

I pray for all those that are needing hope, strength and encouragement. Please minister to them now. I pray that You would work in their hearts. Dry their tears. Take away their fears. Be their Healer, Comforter, and Provider. You know who is struggling and You know each one by nane. Please have compassion and mercy, and may they feel Your Presence like never before. In the name of Jesus we pray, Amen.
